The Arduino Due is a groundbreaking microcontroller board featuring the Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU, making it the first Arduino board built around a 32-bit ARM core microcontroller. With its 54 digital input/output pins, 12 analog inputs, 4 UARTs, USB OTG capability, and 84 MHz clock, the Due offers enhanced performance and versatility for a wide range of projects. Compatible with all Arduino shields designed for operation at 3.3V and compliant with the 1.0 Arduino pinout standard, the Due is a powerful tool for both beginners and experienced makers alike.

**Warning: Unlike most Arduino boards, the Arduino Due board runs at 3.3V. The maximum voltage that the I/O pins can tolerate is 3.3V. Applying voltages higher than 3.3V to any I/O pin could damage the board.**

### Block Diagram

<!---
Block Diagram: The block diagram is really important from the technical point of view and for certification purposes. Must be good and consistent with Arduino`s visual style. The raw diagram is created by the R&D team and adapted and converted to the final one by the content team using Figma. Clock signals are mandatory for certification purposes. Diagram and text for example purposes.
-->

The block diagram with the main parts of the product can be checked in the following image:

### Power Supply

<!---
Power tree: The power tree is really important from the technical point of view and for certification purposes. Must be good and consistent with Arduino`s visual style. The raw diagram is created by the R&D team and adapted and converted to the final one by the content team using Figma. Diagram and text for example purposes.
-->

The Arduino Due can be powered through multiple interfaces:

- USB Type-B port (Native port and Programming port)
- The Due can also be powered using an external voltage source connected to the VIN pin, which has a recommended voltage range of 7 to 12 V.
- The Power Jack: alternatively, the Due can be powered using a DC power supply connected to the power jack, which accepts a voltage range of 7 to 12 V.

**It is essential to note that the Arduino Due operates at 3.3 V, so any external power sources must be regulated to this voltage level. Additionally, the power supply should be able to provide sufficient current for the board's operation and any connected peripherals.**

### Product Topology

<!---
Product Topology: Product topology is an important section of the datasheet and a combination of two elements: the diagram with the main components references, and the table listing and describing those main components. It is important to describe only the components interesting for the final user, so capacitors, resistors and other passive components should not be described in this section as a general rule. Image and text for example purposes

<!---
Product Topology specific subsections: Different subsections about specific features and important parts of the product can be added inside the product topology, explaining for example more information about the microprocessors, the MIPI camera connector, the GPS connectivity, the GPIO pins, JTAG connectors, USB, etc etc. Some of the Portenta Hat Carrier specific sections have been added as a nice example.

## Device Operation

<!---
Device Operation: This section is the only section where we mention software-related topics, like IDEs and additional documentation, tools and resources. Normally is generic and only needs to change names and make sure citations are in order but make sure that is this way for your products. Some products are also compatible with Linux, micropython or PLC IDE.
-->

### Getting Started - IDE

If you want to program your Arduino Due while offline you need to install the Arduino® Desktop IDE **[1]**. To connect the Arduino Due to your computer, you will need a USB Type-B cable, which can also provide power to the board, as indicated by the LED (DL1).

### Getting Started - Arduino Web Editor

All Arduino boards, including this one, work out-of-the-box on the Arduino® Web Editor **[2]**, by just installing a simple plugin.

The Arduino Web Editor is hosted online, therefore it will always be up-to-date with the latest features and support for all boards. Follow **[3]** to start coding on the browser and upload your sketches onto your board.

### Getting Started - Arduino Cloud

All Arduino IoT enabled products are supported on Arduino Cloud which allows you to log, graph and analyze sensor data, trigger events, and automate your home or business.

### Online Resources

Now that you have gone through the basics of what you can do with the board you can explore the endless possibilities it provides by checking exciting projects on ProjectHub **[4]**, the Arduino Library Reference **[5]**, and the online store **[6]**; where you will be able to complement your board with sensors, actuators and more.

### Board Recovery

<!---
Board Recovery:  Make sure to explain how to put the board in recovery mode. If that information is not available, please remove.

Exemptions: No exemptions are claimed.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Arduino Boards are fully compliant with the related requirements of European Union Regulation (EC) 1907 /2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). We declare none of the SVHCs (https://echa.europa.eu/web/guest/candidate-list-table), the Candidate List of Substances of Very High Concern for authorization currently released by ECHA, is present in all products (and also package) in quantities totaling in a concentration equal or above 0.1%. To the best of our knowledge, we also declare that our products do not contain any of the substances listed on the "Authorization List" (Annex XIV of the REACH regulations) and Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in any significant amounts as specified by the Annex XVII of Candidate list published by ECHA (European Chemical Agency) 1907 /2006/EC.</p>

### Conflict Minerals Declaration

<p style="text-align: justify;">As a global supplier of electronic and electrical components, Arduino is aware of our obligations with regard to laws and regulations regarding Conflict Minerals, specifically the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502. Arduino does not directly source or process conflict minerals such as Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, or Gold. Conflict minerals are contained in our products in the form of solder or as a component in metal alloys. As part of our reasonable due diligence, Arduino has contacted component suppliers within our supply chain to verify their continued compliance with the regulations. Based on the information received thus far we declare that our products contain Conflict Minerals sourced from conflict-free areas.</p>
